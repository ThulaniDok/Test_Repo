# Allan Gray Software Testing Assessment Answers

## Assignmnet 1 - Test Design and Reasoning

### 1 - What questions would you ask to aid in your testing better?
- Should a member confirm editing their details?
- Can a name or contact be updated with an empty value?
- Can a user edit a contact to an existing contact?

### 2 - In your opinion, what are the three most important things that need to be tested and why?
- Can a use edit their details without login? This is for security reasons and making sure that wa user can only edit their details.
- Can the user successfully edit their name and contact. This is the main requirement of the feature. 
- Is a message/email informing the user of updated details sent to their contact address? This is to confirm and inform the user the their details have be changed in case their details were changed without their consent.

### 3 - Which layer would you focus your testing efforts on and why?
- I would focus on the client/interface layer because it covers most levels of the system without duplicating effor.
- It covers itntegration between the microservices will be covered
- It also covers frontend and Backend validation will be covered

### 4 - What dependencies on other micro services could you see that may impact testing?
- Dependency on the Get member microservice. In order to edit a member you need to return the member frist.
- Email validation to confirm the new email is valid.
- Validation microservice to validate input details.

## Assignmnet 2 - SQL Comprehension

### 1 - How many users does this database contain?
    `SELECT count(*) AS user_count from Users;`

### 2 - How many users were created each calendar year (since the beginning of 2010) in this database?
    `SELECT COUNT(*) AS user_count, YEAR(CreationDate) AS calendar_year 
      FROM Users 
      GROUP BY YEAR(CreationDate)
      HAVING YEAR(CreationDate) >= 2010;`

### 3 - How many posts of type "Question" has the user "Mat Mannion" asked since he joined?
    `SELECT Count(*)
      FROM Posts
      INNER JOIN PostTypes ON Posts.PostTypeId = PostTypes.Id
      WHERE Posts.OwnerDisplayName = 'Mat Mannion'
      AND PostTypes.Name = 'Question';`

### 4 - What is the name of the most reputable "South Africa" user and how many "Enlightened" badges did they receive in 2016?
    `SELECT TOP 1 DisplayName
    , Reputation 
    FROM Users
    WHERE Location = 'South Africa'
    ORDER BY Reputation DESC`

### 5 - Provide another query that returns the same result as the question above. Which is the more optimal query and why?

    SELECT u.DisplayName
    , u.Reputation 
    FROM Users u
    WHERE u.Location = 'South Africa'
    AND u.Reputation =
    (
      SELECT Max(u1.Reputation)
      FROM Users u1
      WHERE u1.Location = u.Location  
    )

### 6 - Did you have to make any assumptions in the queries above? If you did, what were they and what was your thinking?
- I assume that there is only one max count  

## Assignmnet 3 - Code Comprehension

### 1 - What is this test attempting to do?
- This test attempts to get the results of a search entry `Andrew` from the `https://api.com/v1/people` application
- Store the resposne
- Delete the 3rd [2] result from the response and confirm 204 status code returned
- Get the the 3rd result from the application again and confirm that after deletion the result in not found and a 403 status code is returned

### 2 - What are the problems with this test?
- There no comments
- Missing `})` at the end
- Chai assertion librabry missing

### 3 - What other improvements can you suggest?
- Make the description of the test case more descriptive of what the test is doing
- 


    'use strict';
    const chai = require("chai");
    const request = require('request');

    const queryParams = {
        searchPhrase: 'Andrew'
    };

    const it = chai.it;
    const expect = chai.expect;
        
    const url = 'https://api.com/v1/people';

    describe('api test', () => {
      it('test case 1', () => {
        const response = request.get(url, queryParams);
        const personId = response.results[2].id;
        const deleteResponse = request.delete(`url/${personId}`);
        expect(deleteResponse.statusCode).to.eql(204);
        const afterDeleteGet = request.get(`url/${personId}`);
        expect(afterDeleteGet.statusCode).to.eql(404);
        }
      );
    })


## Assignmnet 4 - Ability to write an automated test

### 1 - Given the following code â€“ write an automated test that would be able to verify that the function is working correctly (feel free to use any coding language of your choice):


    'use strict';
    const chai = require('chai').assert;
    const validation = require('validation');

    let number1 = "073-637-8650";
    let number2 = "01125121";
    int number3 = 0763118650;

    describe('App', function() {
      it('validation should return Cellphone number is valid', function(){
        let result = validation(number1);
        assert.equal(result, 'Cellphone number is valid');
      });

      it('validation should be a string', function(){
        let result = validation(number1);
        assert.typeOf(result, 'string');
      });
    });
